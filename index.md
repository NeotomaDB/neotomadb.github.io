These are resources for individuals working with paleoecological data.  This site includes links to:

  * [Database Documentation](http://open.neotomadb.org/schema)
  * [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks
  * [Neotoma API Documentation](http://api-dev.neotomadb.org)
  * [Neotoma Project Wishlist]()

These tools are intended to help people work with paleoecological data, and an effort to communicate best-practices in the paleogeosciences.  The repository includes fully realized workflows and more focused "cookbook" type elements.

This resource is linked to the GitHub repository for the Neotoma Database, and specifically to a [Workbooks](http://github.com/neotomadb/Workbooks) repository.  We welcome contributions from all users.  These contributions may include code or documentation, or feedback.  Let us know how the workbooks worked for you!
