These are resources for individuals working with paleoecological data.  The workbooks are constructed using tools including [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and other tools such as [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).  These tools are intended to help people work with paleoecological data, and an effort to communicate best-practices in the paleogeosciences.  The repository includes fully realized workflows and more focused "cookbook" type elements.

This resource is linked to the GitHub repository for the Neotoma Database, and specifically to a [Workbooks](http://github.com/neotomadb/Workbooks) repository.  We welcome contributions from all users.  These contributions may include code or documentation, or feedback.  Let us know how the workbooks worked for you!
