These are resources for individuals working with paleoecological data.  This site includes links to:

* Database documentation
  * [Database Schema](/dbschema)
  * [Neotoma Postgres Database Manual](/manual)
* RMarkdown and Jupyter notebooks:
  * [Simple workflows with `neotoma2`](https://open.neotomadb.org/EPD_binder/simple_workflow.html) showing how to search for and download data. This includes stratigraphic plots and plots of proportional change over time.
  * [Complex workflows with `neotoma2`](https://open.neotomadb.org/EPD_binder/complex_workflow.html) showing how to build and add new chronologies to a record.
* [Neotoma API Documentation](https://api.neotomadb.org)
* [Neotoma Dataset Landing Pages](https://data.neotomadb.org)

These tools are intended to help people work with paleoecological data, and an effort to communicate best-practices in the paleogeosciences.  The repository includes fully realized workflows and more focused "cookbook" type elements.

This resource is linked to the GitHub repository for the Neotoma Database, and specifically to a [Workbooks](http://github.com/neotomadb/Workbooks) repository. We welcome contributions from all users. These contributions may include code or documentation, or feedback.  Let us know how the workbooks worked for you!
