These are resources intended for individuals working with paleoecological data.  The workbooks are constructed using tools including RMarkdown, Jupyter and other workbook type software.  These tools are intended to help people work with paleoecological data, and an effort to communicate best-practices in the paleogeosciences.

This resource is linked to the GitHub repository for the Neotoma Database, and specifically to a [Workbooks](http://github.com/neotomadb/Workbooks) repository.  We welcome contributions from all users.  These contributions may include code or documentation, or feedback.  Let us know how the workbooks worked for you!
