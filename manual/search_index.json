Grimm (Jacobson 2021) who has spent countless hours developing this manual. In addition, Neotoma rests on the work of a number of researchers who contributed to the original North American Pollen Database, and subsequent data contributors, including FAUNMAP contributors and the data contributions of Allan Ashworth. The Neotoma Database would not exist were it not for the ongoing contributions of authors, data analysts and funding agencies, in particular the National Sciences Foundation. This manual draws heavily from Eric Grimm’s original Neotoma manual (v2), published as (E. Grimm 2008).

The database stores associated physical data from fossil bearing deposits, for example sediment loss-on-ignition and geochemical data. The database also stores data from modern samples that are used to interpret fossil data. The initial development of Neotoma was funded by a grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation Geoinformatics program. The inital grant was a collaborative proposal between Penn State University (R. Graham 2006) and the Illinois State Museum (E. C. Grimm 2006). It had five Principle Investigators, Russell W. Graham, Eric C. Grimm, Stephen T. Jackson, Allan C. Ashworth, and John W. (Jack) Williams. Initially, data within Neotoma were merged from four existing databases: the Global Pollen Database, 2.3.3\">FAUNMAP, a database of mammalian fauna (FAUNMAP Working Group 1994), the North American Plant Macrofossil Database, and a 2.3.4\">fossil beetle database assembled by Allan Ashworth. Although structurally different, these databases contain similar kinds of data, and merging them was quite practical. The rationale for this merging was twofold: To facilitate analyses of past biotic communities at the ecosystem level To reduce the overhead in maintaining and distributing several independent databases. Because the proxy types that Neotoma integrated were sufficiently diverse, the data model had to focus on the commonalities as the core of the database structure, specifically elements of stratigraphy and chronology. This design facilitated the gradual inclusion of other database types including the addition of ostracode, diatom, chironmid, and freshwater mussel datasets. The Neotoma database was initially designed by Eric C. Grimm and implemented in Microsoft® Access®. Neotoma was ported to SQL Server, where it was served from the Center for Environmental Informatics at Penn State University. Subsequently the database was ported to PostgreSQL, to support a fully open data ecosystem with an Application-Program Interface (API) that could be integrated into R packages (e.g., Goring et al. 2015) or other programming languages. 2.1 Whence Neotoma A packrat of the genus Neotoma. Credit: Alan Cressler, CC BY-SA 2.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0, via Wikimedia Commons Neotoma was called a “Late Neogene Terrestrial Ecosystem Database” in the original NSF proposal. At the time this proposal was written, the Neogene Period included the Miocene, Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene epochs. However, a proposal before the International Commission on Stratigraphy elevated the Quaternary to a System or Period following the Neogene (Gibbard et al. 2010), terminating the Neogene at the end of Pliocene. To account for the change in nomenclature, numerous names and companion acronyms were considered, but none engendered enthusiastic support. B. Brandon Curry proposed the name Neotoma, and this name struck a fancy. Neotoma is the genus for the packrat. Packrats are prodigious collectors of anything in their territory, and moreover they are collectors of fossil data. Neotoma packrats collect plant macrofossils and bones, and pollen is preserved in their amberat – hardened, dried urine, which impregnates their middens and preserves them for millennia. 2.2 Rationale Paleobiological data from the recent geological past have been invaluable for understanding ecological dynamics at timescales inaccessible to direct observation, including ecosystem evolution, contemporary patterns of biodiversity, principles of ecosystem organization, particularly the individualistic response of species to environmental gradients, and the biotic response to climatic change, both gradual and abrupt. Understanding the dynamics of ecological systems requires ecological time series, but many ecological processes operate too slowly to be amenable to experimentation or direct observation. In addition to having ecological significance, fossil data have tremendous importance for climatology and global change research. Fossil floral and faunal data are crucial for climate-model verification and are essential for elucidating climate-vegetation interactions that may partly control climate. Basic paleobiological research is site based, and paleobiologists have devoted innumerable hours to identifying, counting, and cataloging fossils from cores, sections, and excavations. These data are typically published in papers describing single sites or small numbers of sites. Often, the data are published graphically, as in a pollen diagram, and the actual data reside on the investigator’s computer or in a file cabinet. These basic data are similar to museum collections, costly to replace, sometimes irreplaceable, and their value does not diminish with time. Also similar to museum collections, the data require cataloging and curation. Whereas physical specimens of large fossils, such as animal bones, are typically accessioned into museums, microfossils, such as pollen, are not accessioned, and the digital data are the primary objects, and their loss is equivalent to losing valuable museum specimens. The integrated database that we propose ensures safe, long-term archiving of these data. Large independent databases exist for fossil pollen, plant macrofossils, and mammals: the Global Pollen Database (GPD), the North American Plant Macrofossil Database (NAPMD), and FAUNMAP. In addition, a database of fossil beetles (BEETLE) has been assembled and integrated into Neotoma. These databases, as with others in the Earth and ecosystem sciences, have become essential cyberinfrastructure. Nevertheless, these resources were originally developed as standalone databases in the early 1990’s. GPD and NAPMD were stored in Paradox® file formats; FAUNMAP in Microsoft Access. Since initial database development, emphasis has been placed on ingest of new and legacy data. However, database and Internet technology have advanced greatly since 1995, and the current relational database software, ingest programs, data retrieval algorithms, output formats, and analysis tools are outdated and minimal. Moreover, the databases are not linked, so that integrated analyses are difficult. Although GPD, NAPMD, and FAUNMAP were developed independently, they have much in common. The basic data of all three databases as well as BEETLE are essentially lists of taxa from cores, excavations, or sections, often with quantitative measures of abundance. The three databases include similar metadata. The objective of Neotoma is to build a unified data structure that will incorporate all of these databases. The database will initially incorporate pollen, plant macrofossil, mammal, and beetle data. However, the database designed facilitates the incorporation of all kinds of fossil data. Various teams of investigators have developed databases for paleobiological data that have been project or discipline based, including the four databases to be integrated in this project. However, long-term maintenance and sustainability have been problematic because of the need to secure continuous funding. Nevertheless, these databases have become the established archives for their disciplines and, new data are continuously contributed. However, because of funding hiatuses, long spells may intervene between times of data contribution and their public availability. For example, the plant macrofossil database has not incorporated any new data since 1999. The number of different databases and disciplines exacerbates the problem, because each database requires a database manager. Consolidation of informatics technology helps address this overhead issue. However, specialists are still essential for management and supervision of data collection and quality control for their disciplines or organismal groups. The purposes of Neotoma are: to facilitate studies of ecosystem development and response to climate change to provide the historical context for understanding biodiversity dynamics, including genetic diversity to provide the data for climate-model validation to provide a safe, long-term, low-cost archive for a wide variety of paleobiological data. Site-based studies are invaluable in their own right, and they are the generators of new data. However, much is gained by marshalling data from geographic arrays of sites for synoptic, broad-scale ecosystem studies. In order to carry out such studies efficiently, a queryable database is required. Thus, it is much morethan an archive; it is essential cyberinfrastructure for paleoenvironmental research. The database facilitates integration, synthesis, and understanding, and it promotes information sharing and collaboration. The individual databases have been extensively used for scientific research, with several hundred scientific publications directly based upon data drawn from these databases. This project will enhance those databases and will continue their public access. By integrating these databases and by simplifying the contributor interface, we can reduce the number of people necessary for community-wide database maintenance, and thereby help ensure their long-term sustainability and existence. 2.3 History of the Constituent Databases 2.3.1 Global Pollen Database In an early effort, the Cooperative Holocene Mapping Project (COHMAP Members 1988; Wright et al. 1993) assembled pollen data in the 1970s and 1980s to test climate models. Although data-model comparison was the principal objective of the COHMAP project, the synoptic analyses of the pollen data, particularly maps showing the constantly shifting ranges of species in response to climate change, were revelatory and led to much ecological insight (e.g. Webb 1981, 1987, 1988). The COHMAP pollen “database” was a set of flat files with a fixed file format for data and for chronologies. FORTRAN programs were written to read these files and to assemble data for particular analyses. Thompson Webb III managed the COHMAP pollen database at Brown University, but as the quantity of data increased, data management became increasingly cumbersome; the data needed to be migrated to a relational database management system. Discussions with E. C. Grimm led to the initiation of the North American Pollen Database (NAPD) in 1990. At the same time in , the International Geological Correlation Project IGCP 158 (Church 1989) was conducting a major collaborative synthesis of paleoecological data, primarily of pollen, making the need for a pollen database painfully obvious. In the forward to the book resulting from this project (Berglund et al. 1996), J.L. de Beaulieu describes the role that the IGCP 158 project had in launching the European Pollen Database (Huntley and Prentice 1993). A workshop to develop a European Pollen Database (EPD) was held in in 1. North American representatives also attended, and the organizers of NAPD and EPD commenced a long-standing collaboration to develop compatible databases. NAPD and EPD held several joint workshops and developed the same data structure. Nevertheless, the two databases were independently established, partly because Internet capabilities were not yet sufficient to easily manage a merged database. The pollen databases were developed in Paradox, which at the time was the most powerful RDBMS readily available for the PC platform. NAPD and EPD established two important protocols: the databases were relational and queryable they were publicly available. As the success the NAPD-EPD partnership escalated, working groups initiated pollen databases for other regions, including the Latin American Pollen Database (LAPD) in 1994, the Pollen Database for and the Russian Far East (PDSRFE) in 1995, and the African Pollen Database (APD) in 1996. At its initial organizational workshop, LAPD opted to merge with NAPD, rather than develop a standalone database, and the Global Pollen Database was born. PDSRFE also followed this model. APD developed independently, but uses the table structure of GPD and EPD. Pollen database projects have also been initiated in other regions, and the GPD contains some of these data, including the Indo-Pacific Pollen Database and the Japanese Pollen Database. ## Warning: Ignoring unknown parameters: binwidth, bins, pad ## Don&#39;t know how to automatically pick scale for object of type integer64. Defaulting to continuous. ## Warning: Removed 4349 rows containing missing values (position_stack). Figure 2.1: Sample age distributions in Neotoma for a subset of Neotoma data. Ages are heavily skewed to samples in the last 10,000 years, and moreso to the near-present. The pollen databases contain data from the Holocene, Pleistocene, and Pliocene, although most data are from the last 20,000 years (Fig. 2.1). Included are fossil data, mainly from cores and sections, and modern surface samples, which are essential for calibrating fossil data. NAPD data are not separate from the GPD, but rather the NAPD is the North American subset of GPD. EPD has both public and restricted data — a concession that had to be made early on to assuage some contributors. 2.3.2 North American Plant Macrofossil Database Plant macrofossils include plant organs generally visible to the naked eye, including seeds, fruits, leaves, needles, wood, bud scales, and megaspores. Synoptic-scale mapping of plant macrofossils from modern assemblages (Jackson et al. 1997) and fossil assemblages (Jackson et al. 1997, 2000; Jackson and Booth 2002) have shown the utility of plant macrofossils in providing spatially and taxonomically precise reconstructions of past species ranges. Although plant macrofossil records are spatially precise, synoptic networks of high-quality sites can scale up to yield aggregate views of past distributions (Jackson et al. 1997). In addition, macrofossils, with their greater taxonomic resolution, augment the pollen data by providing information on which species might have been present, and can resolve issues of long-distance transport (Birks 2003). The North American Plant Macrofossil Database (NAPMD) has been directed by S.T. Jackson at the . Highest priority has been placed on data from the last 30,000 years, although some earlier Pleistocene and late Pliocene data are included. The database originated as a research database for selected taxa from Late Quaternary sediments of eastern North America (Jackson et al. 1997). In 1994, an effort was initiated with NOAA funding to build on this foundation to develop a cooperative, relational database comprising all of , a longer time span, and all plant taxa. The structure of NAPMD was adapted from the pollen database and was also stored in a Paradox file format. Although the plant macrofossil database was well served by the data model structure, modifications were made to accommodate different organs from the same species and to deal with the various quantitative measures of abundance. The Plant Macrofossil database also included surface samples, which were not part of the pollen databases at the time, but are useful for the interpretation of fossil data. 2.3.3 FAUNMAP R.W. Graham, E.L. Lundelius, Jr., and a group of Regional Collaborators organized a project to develop a database for late Quaternary faunal data from the , which the U.S. NSF funded in 1990. This project had a research agenda, and its seminal paper focused on the individualistic behavior displayed by animal species (FAUNMAP Working Group 1994). Two FAUNMAP databases exist, FAUNMAP I and FAUNMAP II. Both databases were coordinated by R. W. Graham and E. L. Lundelius, Jr. and funded by NSF. Both are relational databases for fossil mammal sites. The data were extracted from peer-reviewed literature, selected theses and dissertations, and selected contract reports for both paleontology and archaeology (all data is currently contained within the Neotoma publications tables). Unpublished collections were not included. Data were originally captured in Paradox but were later migrated to Microsoft Access. FAUNMAP I contains data from sites in the continental United States (the lower 48 States) that date between 500 BP and ~40,000 BP. Funding for FAUNMAP I ended in 1994, with the production of two major publications by the FAUNMAP Working Group (FAUNMAP Working Group 1994; Group 1996), along with publications from individual members and many others who accessed the database on-line. Graham and Lundelius continued the FAUNMAP project, developing FAUNMAP II with funding from NSF beginning in 1998. FAUNMAP II (Graham R. W. and E. L. Lundelius 2010) shares the same structure as FAUNMAP I but expands the spatial coverage to include and and extends the temporal coverage to the Pliocene (5 Ma). In addition, sites published since 1994, when FAUNMAP I was completed, have been added for the contiguous 48 States. In all, FAUNMAP I and II contain more than 5000 fossil-mammal sites with more than 600 mammal species for all of North America north of Mexico that range in age from 0.5 ka to 5 Ma­. The detailed structure of the FAUNMAP database is described in FAUNMAP Working Group (FAUNMAP Working Group 1994). Sites identified by name and location were subdivided into Analysis Units (AU’s), which varied from site to site depending upon the definitions used in the original publications (e.g., stratigraphic horizons, cultural horizons, excavation levels, biostratigraphic zones). All data (i.e., taxa identified, and counts of individual specimens) and metadata (sediment types, depositional environments, facies, radiometric and other geochronological dates, modifications of bone) were associated with the individual AUs. This structure – analysis units within sites – allows for information to be extracts at the site level, or at the smallest sample subdivision. The analysis unit permits fine-scale temporal resolution and analysis. Similar to the GPD and NAPMD, FAUNMAP contains archival and research tables. Similar to the plant macrofossil database, FAUNMAP contains a variety of quantitative measures of abundance (e.g., MNI, NISP), and presence data are more commonly used for analysis. 2.3.4 BEETLE Many beetles have highly specific ecological and climatic requirements and are valuable indicators of past environments (Morgan et al. 1983; Allan C. Ashworth, n.d.; A. C. Ashworth 2004). Coleoptera is one of the most diverse groups of organisms on Earth, and of the insects, perhaps the most commonly preserved as fossils. Allan Ashworth has assembled a database of fossil beetles from . The data, which were recorded in Excel, contain 5523 individual records of 2567 taxa from 199 sites and 165 publications. Metadata include site name, latitude and longitude, lithology of sediment, absolute age, and geological age. The basic data are similar to plant and mammal databases – lists of taxa from sites. The metadata have not been recorded to the extent of the other databases, especially chronological data, but Ashworth has resolved the taxonomic issues and has assembled the publications, so that the additional metadata can be easily pulled together. 2.4 Who Will Use Neotoma? The existing databases have been used widely for a variety of studies. Because the databases have been available on-line, precise determination of how many publications have made use of them is difficult. In addition, the databases are widely used for instructional purposes. Below are examples of the kinds of people who have used these databases and who we expect will find the new, integrated database even more useful. Paleoecologists seeking to place a new record into a regional/continental/global context (e.g., Bell and Mead 1998, Czaplewski et al. 1999, Bell and Barnosky 2000, Newby et al. 2000, Futyma and Miller 2001, Gavin et al. 2001, Czaplewski et al. 2002, Schauffler and Jacobson 2002, Camill et al. 2003, Rosenberg et al. 2003, Willard et al. 2003, Pasenko and Schubert 2004, and many others). Synoptic paleoecologists interested in mapping regional to sub-continental to global patterns of vegetation change (e.g., Jackson et al. 1997, Williams et al. 1998, Jackson et al. 2000, Prentice et al. 2000, Thompson and Anderson 2000, Williams et al. 2000, Williams et al. 2001, Williams 2003, Webb et al. 2004, Williams et al. 2004, Asselin and Payette 2005). Synoptic paleoclimatologists building benchmark paleoclimatic reconstructions for GCM evaluation (e.g., Bartlein et al. 1998, Farrera et al. 1999, Guiot et al. 1999, Kohfeld and Harrison 2000, CAPE Project Members 2001, Kageyama et al. 2001, Kaplan et al. 2003). Paleontologists trying to understand the timing, patterns, and causes of extinction events (e.g., Jackson and Weng 1999, Graham 2001, Barnosky et al. 2004, Martínez-Meyer et al. 2004, Wroe et al. 2004). Evolutionary biologists mapping the genetic legacies of Quaternary climatic variations (e.g., Petit et al. 1997, Fedorov 1999, Tremblay and Schoen 1999, Hewitt 2000, Comps et al. 2001, Good and Sullivan 2001, Petit et al. 2002, Kropf et al. 2003, Lessa et al. 2003, Petit et al. 2003, Hewitt 2004, Lascoux et al. 2004, Petit et al. 2004, Whorley et al. 2004, Runck and Cook 2005). Macroecologists interested in temporal records of species turnover and biodiversity and historical controls on modern patterns of floristic diversity (e.g., Silvertown 1985, Qian and Ricklefs 2000, Brown et al. 2001, Haskell 2001). Archeologists who are studying human subsistence patterns and interactions with their environment (e.g., Grayson 2001, Grayson and Meltzer 2002, Cannon and Meltzer 2004, Grayson in press). Natural resource managers who need to know historical ranges and abundances of plants and animals for designing conservation and management plans (e.g., Graham and Graham 1994, Cole et al. 1998, Noss et al. 2000, Owen et al. 2000, Committee on Ungulate Management in Yellowstone National Park 2002, Burns et al. 2003) Scientists trying to understand the potential response of plants, animals, biomes, ecosystems, and biodiversity to global warming (e.g., Bartlein et al. 1997, Davis et al. 2000, Barnosky et al. 2003, Burns et al. 2003, Kaplan et al. 2003, Schmitz et al. 2003, Jackson and Williams 2004, Martínez-Meyer et al. 2004) Teachers who use the databases for teaching purposes and class exercises. References "],["sql-quickly.html", "3 SQL Quickly 3.1 SQL Example 3.2 Table Keys 3.3 Data Types", " 3 SQL Quickly SQL (Sturctured Query Language) is a standard language for querying and modifying relational databases. There is an official standard for SQL, statements such as SELECT and WHERE are common across most SQL implementations, however, individual vendors do maintain proprietary formatting. Neotoma is implemented using PostgreSQL, which has extensive documentation online. It is beyond the scope of this document to teach SQL, however, we have included a large number of SQL queries along with the documentation to provide templates for queries, and to help the user understand how to directly work with the database. These queries can by typed or copied and pasted into database tools such as pgAdmin. Throughout the document we will refer to tables using the format ndb.tablename. Here ndb is the schema for most of the data tables within the Neotoma database. There are other schema, including apps, doi and public, but the data tables themselves are kept in the ndb schema. You can see all available data tables in the ndb schema using the Neotoma database schema website. 3.1 SQL Example The following SQL example lists the number of sites by the geopolitical unit, where the geopolitical unit is a country. It uses three tables, ndb.sites, which contains site information, ndb.geopoliticalunits, which lists all geopolitical units (countries, provinces, towns, etc.), and a JOIN table, which helps to link the ndb.sites table to the ndb.geopoliticalunits table. By convention, SQL first defines the output, using the SELECT statement. The FROM block is used to explain how the information is brought together, and the WHERE (and subsequent blocks) are meant to help filter and aggregate data as generated within the FROM block. Throughput this document we will use AS statemements to help us write our SQL queries neatly. Using AS helps us create an alias so that we don’t have to write so much in our query. As much as possible we will use the same aliases for tables throughout this guide. For example, FROM ndb.sites AS st is commonly used, where st becomes the alias for the ndb.sites table, and stands in for it elsewhere in the query. Often you will see gpu used for ndb.geopoliticalunits, or tx for ndb.taxa. In Postgres SQL it is not neccessary to use the term AS (we use it here to make the queries clearer for folks just learning how to use SQL), so it’s possible to see things like ndb.sites st in place of ndb.sites AS st. Below is an example where both forms are used: 3.1.1 Query 3.1.1.1 SQL Query SELECT COUNT(*) AS sites, gpu.geopoliticalname, gpu.geopoliticalunit FROM ndb.geopoliticalunits AS gpu INNER JOIN ndb.sitegeopolitical AS sgp ON sgp.geopoliticalid = gpu.geopoliticalid INNER JOIN ndb.sites st ON st.siteid = sgp.siteid WHERE gpu.geopoliticalunit = &#39;country&#39; GROUP BY gpu.geopoliticalid HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 0 ORDER BY sites DESC; 3.1.1.2 Output DT::datatable(geopoliticalsort) 3.2 Table Keys Within tables there are often Keys. A Key may be a Primary Key (PK), which acts as a unique identifier for individual records within a table, or they may be a Foreign Key (FK) which refers to a unique identifier in another table. Primary Keys and Foreign Keys are critical to join tables in a SQL query. In relational databases such as Neotoma you will often have “entity” tables, that represent explicit things (e.g., people, sites), and then tables that express the relationship between entities using foreign keys. So, for example the table ndb.sitegeopoliticalunits expresses the relationship between ndb.sites and ndb.geopoliticalunits. Both ndb.sites and ndb.geopoliticalunits represent entities; a country is a thing, with properties, as is a site. The ndb.sitegeopoliticalunits defines the relationship betwen these things. It is a table with two columns, one is an FK that refers back to the PK, siteids, in ndb.sites, and one is an FK for the primary key of the ndb.geopoliticalunits. Switching to the SQL Query tab in the above example will show you that we are using the PK for the geopoliticalunits, geopoliticalid. It links the complete information in the ndb.geopoliticalunits table to the ndb.sites table, through a JOIN table, that has two columns, the siteid that is the PK for ndb.sites and the geopoliticalid column, that is the PK for ndb.geopoliticalunits. In this way, siteid is the PK in ndb.sites and an FK in ndb.sitegeopoliticalunits. 3.3 Data Types Neotoma uses several standard SQL data types. You can find out more about these individual data types in the Postgres data type documentation. 3.3.1 Query 3.3.1.1 SQL Query 3.3.1.2 Data DT::datatable(datatypes) "],["database-design-concepts.html", "4 Database Design Concepts 4.1 Sites, Collection Units, Analysis Units, Samples, and Datasets 4.2 Taxa and Variables 4.3 Taxonomy and Synonymy 4.4 Taxa and Ecological Groups 4.5 Chronology 4.6 Sediment and Depositional Environments 4.7 Date Fields", " 4 Database Design Concepts 4.1 Sites, Collection Units, Analysis Units, Samples, and Datasets Fossil data are site based. A Site[#Sites] has a name, latitude-longitude coordinates, altitude, and areal extent. In Neotoma, Sites are designated geographically as boxes with north and south latitude coordinates and east and west longitude coordinates. If the areal extent is not known, the box collapses to a point, with the north and south latitudes equal and the east and west longitudes equal. Most of the legacy sites in Neotoma currently have point coordinates. The lat-long box can circumscribe the site, for example a lake, or it may circumscribe a larger area in which the site lies either because the exact location of the site is not known or because the exact location is purposely kept vague. In the case of many legacy sites, the exact location is not know precisely; for example, it may have been described as «on a gravel bar 5 miles east of town». The exact locations of some sites have purposely been kept vague to prevent looting and vandalism. A Collection Unit[#CollectionUnits] is a unit from a site from which a collection of fossils or other data have been made. Typical Collection Units are cores, sections, and excavation units. A site may have several Collection Units. A Collection Unit is located spatially within a site and may have precise GPS latitude-longitude coordinates. Its definition is quite flexible. For pollen data, a Collection Unit is typically a core, a section, or surface sample. A Collection Unit can also be a composite core comprised of two or more adjacent cores pieced together to form a continuous stratigraphic sequence. A Collection Unit can also be an excavation unit. For faunal data, a Collection Unit could be as precise as an excavation square, or it could be a group of squares from a particular feature within a site. For example, consider a pit cave with three sediment cones, each with several excavation squares. Collection Units could be defined as the individual squares, or as three composite Collection Units, one from each sediment cone. Another example is an archaeological site, from which the reported Collection Units are different structures, although each structure may have had several excavation squares. The precision in the database depends on how data were entered or reported. For many published sites, the data are reported from composite Collection Units. If faunal data are reported from a site or locality without explicit Collection Units, then data are assigned to a single Collection Unit with the name «Locality». This is a «quote». Different kinds of data may have been collected from a single Collection Unit, for example fauna and macrobotanicals from an excavation, or pollen and plant macrofossils from a lake-sediment core. A composite Collection Unit may include data from different milieus, which, nevertheless, are associated with each other, for example a diatom sample from surficial lake sediments and an associated lake-water sample for water-chemistry measurements. The Collection Unit is equivalent to the Entity in the Global Pollen Database but was not defined in FAUNMAP. When the FAUNMAP data were imported into Neotoma, most localities were assigned a single «Locality» Collection Unit. However, for some localities, the data were assigned to different Collection Units that were clearly identifiable in FAUNMAP (see Figure 1). An Analysis Unit[#AnalysisUnits] is a stratigraphic unit within a Collection Unit and is typically defined in the vertical dimension. An Analysis Unit may be a natural stratigraphic unit with perhaps irregular depth and thickness or it may be an arbitrary unit defined by absolute depth and thickness. An excavation may have been dug in arbitrary units, for example 10 cm levels, or it may have followed natural stratagraphic boundaries, for example the «red zone» or a feature in an archaeological site. Although Analysis Units could be designated by an upper depth and lower depth, in Neotoma they are designated by their midpoint depth and thickness, which is more convenient for developing age models. Pollen and other microfossils are typically sampled at arbitrary depths, and although these samples have thicknesses corresponding to the thickness of the sampling device (usually 1 cm or less), these thicknesses are often not reported, just the depths. Different kinds of samples may have been taken from a single analysis unit, for example pollen, diatoms, and ostracodes. The Analysis Unit links these various samples together. In larger excavations, natural stratigraphic Analysis Units may cut across excavation squares or Collection Units, and the data are reported by Analysis Unit rather than by Collection Unit. In this case, the fossil data are assigned to a generic composite Collection Unit named «Locality», which has the explicitly defined Analysis Units. If the Analysis Units are not described or reported, then the data are assigned to a single Analysis Unit with the name «Assemblage». Thus, for a locality published with only faunal list, the fauna are assigned to a Collection Unit named «Locality» and to an Analysis Unit named «Assemblage». In FAUNMAP, Analysis Units are the primary sample units, and fauna are recorded by Analysis Unit. In the GPD, Analysis Units correspond to samples. Samples[#Samples] are of a single data type from an Analysis Unit. For example, there may be a vertebrate faunal sample and a macrobotanical sample from the same Analysis Unit; or there may be a pollen sample and an ostracode sample from the same Analysis Unit. There can be multiple samples of the same data type from an Analysis Unit, for example two pollen samples counted by different analysts. Normally, vertebrate fossils from an Analysis Unit comprise a single sample; however, if the fossils are of mixed age, individually dated bones may be treated as separate samples, each with a precise age. In addition to fossils, samples may also be used for physical measurements, such as loss-on-ignition. Geochronologic measurements, such as radiocarbon dates, are made on geochronologic samples. A Dataset[#Datasets] is a set of Samples of a single data type from a Collection Unit. For example the pollen data from a core comprise a pollen Dataset. The geochronologic samples from a Collection Unit form a geochronologic Dataset. Every Sample is assigned to a Dataset, and every Dataset is assigned to a Collection Unit. Samples from different Collection Units cannot be assigned to the same Dataset (although they may be assigned to Aggregate Datasets). image1 Figure 1. Diagram showing the relationships between tables in Neotoma, the Pollen Database, and FAUNMAP. Because the pollen database has only pollen, no need exists for Analysis Units, which may have multiple data types. FAUNMAP does not make a hierarchical distinction between Collection Units and Analysis Units, and the data for both Analysis Units and fauna are contained in the Faunal table, although within the Faunal table, implicit one-to-many relationships exist between Localities and Analysis Units and between Analysis Units and faunal data. 4.2 Taxa and Variables In general, a sample in Neotoma has a list of taxa with some measure of abundances. The Data[#Data] table in Neotoma has fields for SampleID, VariableID, and Value. Variables, which are listed in the Variables[#Variables] table, consist of a Taxon, referenced in the Taxa[#Taxa] table, as well as the identified Element, measurement Units, Context, and Modification. A Taxon is generally a biological Taxon, but a Taxon may also be a physical attribute such as loss-on-ignition. For biological taxa, the Element is the organ or skeletal element. Typical faunal Elements are bones, teeth, scales, and other hard body parts. Bone and tooth Elements may be specifically identified (e.g. «tibia» or even more precisely «tibia, distal, left», «M2, lower, left»). Some soft Elements also occur in the database (e.g. «hair» and «dung»). For mammals, an unspecified element is «bone/tooth». Elements for plant macrofossils are the organs identified (e.g. «seed», «needle», «cone bract»). Pollen and spores are treated simply as taxon Elements. Thus, Picea seeds, Picea needles, and Picea pollen are three different Variables. All three refer to a single entry in the Taxa table for Picea. Variable Units are the measurement units. For faunal data, the most common are «present/absent», «number of individual specimens» (NISP), and «minimum number of individuals» (MNI). Plant macrofossils have many different quantitative and semi-quantitative measurement Units, including concentrations and relative abundance scales. Measurement Units for pollen are NISP (counts) and «percent». For pollen the preferred measurement Unit is NISP, but for some sites only percentage data are available. Picea pollen NISP and Picea pollen percent are two different Variables. Variable Contexts for fauna include «articulated», «intrusive», and «redeposited». A context for pollen is «anachronic», which refers to a pollen type known to be too old for the contemporary sedimentary deposit. Most Variables do not have a specified context. Variable Modifications include various modifications to fossils or modifiers to Variables, including human modifications to bones (e.g. «bone tool», «human butchering», «burned») and preservational and taphonomic modifications (e.g. «carnivore gnawed», «fragment»). Modifications for pollen include preservational classifications such as «corroded» and «degraded». 4.3 Taxonomy and Synonymy Neotoma does not change or question identifications from original sources, although taxonomic names may be synonymized to currently accepted names. Thus, for example, the old (although still valid) non-standard plant family names such as Gramineae and Compositae are synonimized to their standard family names terminated with «-aceae», viz. Poaceae and Asteraceae. Neotoma has not attempted to establish complete or comprehensive synonymies. However, the Synonyms[#Synonyms] table lists commonly encountered synonyms. The descriptions of the SynonymTypes[#SynonymTypes] and Taxa[#Taxa] tables contain fuller discussions of synonymiztions made in Neotoma. An important feature of Neotoma is that the Taxa[#Taxa] table is hierarchical. Each Taxon has a HigherTaxonID, which is the TaxonID of the next higher taxonomic rank. Thus, data are stored at the highest taxonomic resolution reported by the original investigators, but can be extracted at a higher taxonomic level. Synonymy presents a challenge for any organismal database, particularly for one such as Neotoma, which archives data collected for over a century and which archives extinct taxa, often for which few and fragmentary specimens exist. Many changes are due to increased understanding of the diversity within taxonomic groups and of the phylogenetic relationships within and among groups. Other changes are due purely to taxonomic rules or conventions set by the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (McNeill et al. 2006) and the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature 1999). Working groups representing the different taxonomic groups included in Neotoma have established appropriate taxonomic authorities: Plants – There is no worldwide authority. The International Plant Names Index1 lists validly published names, but a listed name is not necessarily the accepted name for a given taxon. For families, Neotoma follows the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group II (2003) and Stevens (2007+), which follows and updates APG II. The APG is an international consortium of plant taxonomists, and the APG classification utilizes the great quantity of phylogenetic data generated in recent years. For lower taxonomic ranks, the various pollen database cooperatives follow appropriate regional floras: North American Pollen Database/North American Plant Macrofossil Database: Insofar as possible, follows the Flora of North America (Flora of North America Editorial Committee 1993+); about half of the planned FNA volumes have been published. Otherwise, appropriate regional floras are followed. European Pollen Database: The EPD has a Taxonomy Support Group. In general, nomenclature follows Flora Europaea (Tutin 1964-1993). African Pollen Database: The APD has a Committee for Nomenclature, which has produced a list of pollen types with misspellings, synonymy, and nomenclature corrected2. APD nomenclature follows Enumération des plantes à fleurs d'Afrique Tropicale (Lebrun and Stork 1991-1997). Latin American Pollen Database: has a tremendously rich and diverse flora and no comprensive flora is available. Various regional floras are followed. Indo-Pacific Pollen Database: For Australia and adjacent areas follows the Australian Plant Name Index (Chapman 1991). For other regions, appropriate regional floras are followed. Pollen Database for Siberia and the Russian Far East Follows Vascular Plants of Russia and Adjacent States (Czerepanov 1995). Mammals – For extant taxa, the authority is Wilson and Reeder’s (2005) Mammal Species of the World . Original sources are followed for extinct species, and the database is considered authoritative. Birds – For North America, the authority is the American Ornithologists’ Union Check-list of North American Birds (American Ornithologists' Union 1983). Fish – Follows the Catalog of Fishes (Eschmeyer 1998). Mollusks – For North America, follows Common and Scientific Names of Aquatic Invertebrates from the United States and Canada: Mollusks (Turgeon et al. 1998). Beetles – Comprehensive manuals do not exist. Original taxonomic authorities are cited, and the database is considered authoritative. 4.4 Taxa and Ecological Groups In the Taxa[#Taxa] table, each taxon is assigned a TaxaGroupID, which refers to the TaxaGroupTypes[#TaxaGroupTypes] table. These are major taxonomic groups, such as «Vascular plants», «Diatoms», «Testate amoebae», «Mammals», «Reptiles and amphibians», «Fish», and «Molluscs». Also included are «Charcoal» and «Physical variables». Ecological Groups are groupings of taxa within Taxa Groups, which may be ecological or taxonomic. Ecological Groups are assigned in the EcolGroups[#EcolGroups] table, in which taxa are assigned an ecolgroupid, which links to the EcolGroupTypes[#EcolGroupTypes] table, and an EcolSetID, which links to the EcolSetTypes[#EcolSetTypes] table. Ecological Groups are commonly used to organize taxa lists and stratigraphic diagrams. For any taxonomic group, more than one Ecological Set may be assigned. For example, beetles may be assigned to a set of ecological groups, such as dung and bark beetles, and to second set based on taxonomy. Vascular plants are assigned to a «Default plant» set comprised of groups such as «Trees and Shrubs», «Upland Herbs», and «Terrestrial Vascular Cryptogams». Default pollen diagrams can then be generated based on a pollen sum of these three groups. Mammals are assigned to a «Vertebrate orders» set. 4.5 Chronology Neotoma stores both the archival data used to reconstruct chronologies as well as interpreted chronologies derived from the archival data. The basic data used to reconstruct chronologies occurs in three tables: Geochronology[#Geochronology], Tephrachronology[#Tephrachronology], and RelativeChronology[#RelativeChronology]. The Geochronology[#Geochronology] table includes geophysical measurements such as radiocarbon, thermoluminescence, uranium series, and potassium-argon dates. This table also includes dendrochronological dates derived from tree-ring chronologies, for example logs in archaeological structures. The Tephrachronology[#Tephrachronology] table records tephras in Analysis Units. This table refers to the Tephras[#Tephras] lookup table, which stores the ages for known tephras. The RelativeChronology[#RelativeChronology] table stores relative age information for Analysis Units. Relative age scales include the archaeological time scale, geologic time scale, geomagnetic polarity time scale, marine isotope stages, North American land mammal ages, and Quaternary event classification. For example, diagnostic artifacts from an archaeological site may have cultural associations with a known age ranges, which can be assigned to Analysis Units. The faunal assemblage from an Analysis Unit may be assignable to particular land mammal age, which places it within a broad time range. Sedimentary units may be assigned to particular geomagnetic chrons, marine isotope stages, or Quaternary events, such as a particular interglacial. Many of these relative ages have rather broad time spans, but do provide some chronologic control. Actual Chronologies are constructed from the basic chronologic data in the Geochronology[#Geochronology], Tephrachronology[#Tephrachronology], and RelativeChronology[#RelativeChronology] tables. These chronologies are stored in the Chronologies[#Chronologies] table. A Chronology applies to a Collection Unit and consists of a number of Chron Controls, which are ages assigned to Analysis Units. A Chron Control may be an actual geochronologic measurement, such as a radiocarbon date, or it may be derived from the actual measurement, such as a radiocarbon date adjusted for an old carbon reservoir or calibrated to calendar years. A Chron Control may by an average of several radiocarbon dates from the same Analyis Unit. Different kinds of basic chronologic data may be used to assign an age to an Analysis Unit, for example radiocarbon dates and diagnostic archaeological artifacts. Some relative Chron Controls are not from one of the established relative time scales. Examples of these are local biostratigraphic controls, which may be based on dated horizons from nearby sites. A familiar example in is the Ambrosia-rise, which marks European settlement. The exact date varies regionally, depending on when settlement occurred locally. For a given site, the date assigned to the Ambrosia-rise may be based on historical information about when settlement occurred or possibly on geophysical dating (e.g. 210Pb) of a nearby site. image2 For continuous stratigraphic sequences, such as cores, not every Analysis Unit may have a direct date. Therefore, ages are commonly interpolated between dated Analysis Units. In this case, the ChronControls are the age-depth control points for an age model, which may be linear interpolation between Chron Controls or a fitted curve or spline. Figure 2. Smoothed quick radiocarbon calibration curve. At the scale of this figure the difference is mostly less than the line thickness. Age is measured in different time scales, the two most commn being radiocarbon years before present (14C yr BP) or presumed calendar years before present (cal yr BP). For a calibrated radiocarbon date, «cal yr BP» technically stands for «calibrated years before present», i.e. calibrated to calendar years. In Neotoma, «cal yr BP» is used for both calibrated radiocarbon years and for other ages scales presumed to be in calendar years, viz. dendrochronologic years and other geochronlogic ages believed to be in calendar years. The zero datum for any «BP» age is ad 1950, regardless of its derivation. Thus, BP ages younger than ad 1950 are negative—ad 2000 = ‑50 BP. image3 Ages may be reported in ad/bc age units, in which case bc years are stored as negative values. If ages are reported with a datum other than ad 1950 for BP years, the ages must be converted to an ad 1950 datum or to the ad/bc age scale before entry into Neotoma. For example, 210Pb dates are often reported relative to the year of analysis; these must be converted to either ad/bc or «cal yr BP» with an ad 1950 datum. Figure 3. An enlarged portion of Figure 2 showing the monontonic smoothed curve Radiocarbon years can be calibrated to calendar years with a calibration curve. The current calibration curve for ≤26,000 cal yr BP (=21,34114C yr BP) is the NTCAL04 calibration curve (Reimer et al. 2004). Various programs, both online and standalone, are available for calibrating individual radiocarbon dates, two of the more popular are CALIB3 (Stuiver and Reimer 1993) and OxCal4 (Bronk Ramsey 1995, 2001), both available online for download. Calibration of radiocarbon years beyond the INTCAL04 curve is more controversial. However, the Fairbanks0107 curve is available for calibration of radiocarbon dates to 50,000 cal yr BP, the practial limit of radiocarabon dating (Fairbanks et al. 2005, Chiu et al. 2007), with an online application5. Figure 4. Sample ages calculated from the Neotoma quick calibraton curve vs. ages calculated from traditional age models. Calibrated radiocarbon dates better represent the true time scale and the true errors and probability distributions of the age estimates. In addition, other important paleo records, notably the ice cores and tree-ring records, have calendar-year time-scales. Therefore, for comparison among proxies and records, it is clearly desirable to place all records on the same time-scale, viz. a calendar-year time-scale. Although this goal is laudable, most of the data ingested into Neotoma from other databases is on a radiocarbon time scale. The majority of assigned ages and almost all the ages from the pollen database are interpolated ages derived from age models. The proper method for deriving calibrated ages is to calibrate the radiocarbon dates and then reinterpolate new ages between these calibrated dates. Virtually all age models are problematic. A key problem is that most age models linearly interpolate between age-depth points or fit functions or splines to points. However, radiocarbon ages are not points, but probability distributions. Moreover, the probability distributions of calibrated ages are non-Gaussian. Each calibrated age has a unique probability distribution, and many are bimodal or multimodal. Various investigators have used different points, including the intercepts of the radiocarbon age with the calibration curve and the midpoint of the 1σ or 2σ probability distributon. The former is particularly inappropriate (Telford et al. 2004b). The 50% median probability is probably the best single point; however, because of multimodality, this particular point may, in fact, be very unlikely. Nevertheless, if it falls between more-or-less equally probable modes, it may still be the best single point. Most age models for cores are based on relataively few radiocarbon dates, and the uncertainties of the interpolated ages are unknown and large (Telford et al. 2004a). Indeed, chronology is perhaps the greatest challenge for future research with this database. image5 Figure 5. Anomalies (Sample ages from Neotoma default calendar-year age models minus ages calculated with the Neotoma quick calibration curve) vs. time. Given the need for a common age scale and the enormity of the task to properly develop new age models, a RadiocarbonCalibration[#RadiocarbonCalibration] conversion table was developed to quickly convert sample ages in radiocarbon years to calendar years. These calibrated ages are for perusal and data exploration; however, the differences between these ages and those calculated with traditional age models are relatively small. The table contains radiocarbon ages from -100 to 45,000 in 1-year increments with corresponding calibrated values. The table was generated by smoothing the INTCAL04 calibration curve with an FFT filter so that the curve is monotonically increasing, i.e. so that there are no age reversals in calibrated age. The INTCAL04 curve is in 5-yr increments from -5 to 12,500 14C yr BP, 10-yr increments from 12,500 to 15,000 14C yr BP, and 20-yr increments from 15,000 to 26,000 14C yr BP. The FFT filter was 50 points (250 yr) for the first interval, 25 points (250 yr) for the second interval, and 10 points (200 yr) for the third interval. For the calibration beyond 26,000 14C yr BP, a calibrated age was determined with the Fairbanks0107 calibration curve every 100 years with a standard deviation of ±100 years from 20,000±100 14C yr BP to 46,700±100 14C yr BP. These were then smoothed with a 5-sample (500-yr) FFT filter. The curve kinks sharply after 45,000 14C yr BP, so the quick calibration curve was terminated at this date. The Fairbanks0107 curve diverges somewhat from the INTCAL04 curve for the portion they overlap in age. From 20,000 to 26,000 14C yr BP, the difference was prorated linearly from zero divergence from the INTCAL04 curve at 20,000 14C yr BP to zero divergence from the Fairbanks0107 curve at 26,000 14C yr BP. Figure 2 shows the smoothed curve, and Error! Reference source not found. shows an enlargement of part of the curve. An analysis was made to assess the deviation between ages derived from traditionally calibrated age models and ages derived from the quick calibration curve. From the database, 57 default Chronologies in calibrated radiocarbon years were selected. The Chron Controls were all calibrated radiocarbon dates, except for top dates, European settlement dates, and 210Pb dates in the uppermost portions of the cores. A few Chronologies used the Zdanowicz et al. (1999) calendar-year age from the GISP2 ice core. Ages beyond the reliable age limit (Chronologies.AgeBoundOlder[#Chronologies]) were not used. These 57 Chronologies had a total of 1945 Sample Ages in calibrated radiocarbon years. Figure 4 shows graph of ages from the Neotoma age models vs. the ages calculated with the quick calibration curve. Error! Reference source not found. shows the anomalies vs. time and Figure 6 shows a histogram of the distribution of anomalies. Nearly half (47%) of the anomalies are &lt;25 years, 86% are &lt;100 years, 97% are &lt;200 years, and 99.4% are &lt;300 years. The average absolute anomaly is 49.2 years, and the median is 29 years. Thus, the quick calibration curve provides remarkably good results. The ages have no confidence limits, but neither do the interpolated ages of most age models. image6 Figure 6. Binned distribution of anomalies between Neotoma default calendar-year age models and ages calculated with the Neotoma quick calibration curve. 4.6 Sediment and Depositional Environments Several tables deal with depositional environments, depositional agents, and sediment descriptions. In Neotoma, the Depositional Environment refers to the Depositional Environment of the site today, for example, «», «Fen», «Cave», «Colluvial Fan». Depositional Environments may vary within a Site. For example, a lake with a marginal fen has lake and fen Depositional Environments. Thus, Depositional Environments are an attribute of Collection Units and are assigned in the CollectionUnits[#CollectionUnits] table. Depositional Environments are listed in the in the DepEnvtTypes[#DepEnvtTypes] lookup table, and they are hierarchical, for example: Glacial Lacustrine Any of these Depositional Environments may be assigned to a Collection Unit, but because they are hierarchical, Collection Units may be grouped at higher levels, for example, all Collection Units from natural lakes. The top level Depositional Environments, with some examples, are: SELECT depenvt AS &quot;Depositional Environment&quot; FROM ndb.depenvttypes WHERE depenvtid = depenvthigherid LIMIT 10; Table 4.1: Displaying records 1 - 10 Depositional Environment Archaeological Biological Estuarine Lacustrine Marine Palustrine Riverine Sampler Spring Terrestrial The Depositional Environment may change through time. For example, as a basin fills with sediment, it may convert from a lake to a fen and perhaps later to a bog. A colluvial slope may have alluvial sediments at depth. A modern playa lake may have a buried paleosol. Thus, a sediment section may have units with different facies and depositional agents. The Facies is the sum total of the characteristics that distinguish a sedimentary unit. Facies are listed in the FaciesTypes[#FaciesTypes] lookup table and are assigned to Analysis Units in the AnalysisUnits.FaciesID &lt;AnalysisUnits&gt; field. A sedimentary unit may have one or more agents of deposition. For example, a cave deposit may be partly owing to human habitation and partly to carnivore activity. Depositional Agents are listed in the DepAgentTypes[#DepAgentTypes] lookup table and are assigned to Analysis Units in the DepAgents[#DepAgents] table. Whereas Facies and Depositional Agents are both keyed to Analysis Units, the Lithology[#Lithology] table is keyed to Collection Units. Analysis Units, especially from cores, may not be contiguous but be placed at discrete intervals down section. Lithologic units are defined by depth in the Collection Unit. Whereas Facies have short descriptions and are keyed to the FaciesTypes[#FaciesTypes] lookup table, the Lithology.Description[#Lithology] field is a memo, and lithologic descriptions much more detailed than Facies descriptions. FAUNMAP, which was built around Analysis Units, stores Facies and Depositional Agent data; whereas the pollen database, which was centered on Collection Units, stores lithologic data. 4.7 Date Fields Neotoma uses date fields in several tables. Dates are stored internally as a double precision floating point number, which facilitates calculations and functions involving dates. The disadvantage is that complete dates must be stored, i.e. year, month, and day; whereas in many cases only the year or month are known, for example the month a core was collected. Neotoma had adapted the convention that if only the month is known, the day is set to the first of the month; if only the year is known, the month and day are set to January 1. Thus, «June 1984» is set to «June 1, 1984»; and «1984» is set to «January 1, 1984». The drawback, of course, is that these imprecise dates cannot be distinguished from precise dates on the first of the month. However, it was determined that the advantages of the date fields outweighed this disadvantage. http://www.ipni.org↩︎ http://medias.obs-mip.fr/apd/↩︎ http://calib.qub.ac.uk/calib/↩︎ http://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/embed.php?File=oxcal.html↩︎ http://radiocarbon.ldeo.columbia.edu/research/radcarbcal.htm↩︎ "],["neotoma-tables.html", "5 Neotoma Tables 5.1 Site Related Tables 5.2 Dataset &amp; Collection Related Tables 5.3 Chronology &amp; Age Related Tables 5.4 Sample Related Tables 5.5 Taxonomy Related Tables 5.6 Individual Related Tables 5.7 Publication Related Tables", " 5 Neotoma Tables The Neotoma Database contains more than 100 tables and as new proxy types get added, or new metadata is stored, the number of tables may increase or decrease.

Notes: Free form notes or comments about the synonymy. 6.5 synonymtypes Lookup table of Synonym Types. Table is referenced by the synonyms table. SynonymTypeID (Primary Key): An arbitrary Synonym Type identification number. SynonymType: Synonym type. Below are some examples: nomenclatural, homotypic, or objective synonym: a synonym that unambiguously refers to the same taxon, particularly one with the same description or type specimen. These synonyms are particularly common above the species level. For example, Gramineae = Poaceae, Clethrionomys gapperi = Myodes gapperi. The term «objective» is used in zoology, whereas «nomenclatural» or «homotypic» is used in botany. taxonomic, heterotypic, or subjective synonym: a synonym typically based on a different type specimen, but which is now regarded as the same taxon as the senior synonym. For example, Iva ciliata = Iva annua. The term «subjective» is used in zoology, whereas «taxonomic» or «heterotypic» is used in botany. genus merged into another genus: heterotypic or subjective synonym; a genus has been merged into another genus and has not been retained at a subgeneric rank. This synonymy may apply to either the generic or specific level, for example: Petalostemon = Dalea, Petalostemon purpureus = Dalea purpurea. family merged into another family: Heterotypic or subjective synonym; a family has been merged into another family and has not been retained at a subfamilial rank. For example, the Taxodiaceae has been merged with the Cupressaceae. This synonymy creates issues for data entry, because palynologically the Taxodiaceae sensu stricto is sometimes distinguishable from the Cupressaceae sensu stricto. If a pollen type was identified as «Cupressaceae/Taxodiaceae», then synonymizing to «Cupressaceae» results in no loss of information. However, synonymizing «Taxodiaceae» to «Cupressaceae» potentially does. In this case, consultation with the original literature or knowledge of the local biogeography may point to a logical name change that will retain the precision of the original identification. For example, in the southeastern , «Taxodiaceae» can be changed to «Taxodium» or «Taxodium-type» in most situations. If «Cupressaceae» was also identified, then it should be changed to «Cupressaceae undiff.» or possibly «Juniperus-type» if other Cupressaceae such as Chamaecyperus are unlikely. rank change: species reduced to subspecific rank: heterotypic or subjective synonym; a species has been reduced to a subspecies or variety of another species. These synonyms may be treated in two different ways, depending on the situation or protocols of the contributing data cooperative: (1) The taxon is reduced to the subspecific rank (e.g. Alnus fruticosa = Alnus viridis subsp. fruticosa, Canis familiaris = Canis lupus familiaris), either because the fossils can be assigned to the subspecies based on morphology, as is likely the case with the domestic dog, Canis lupus familiaris, or because the subspecies can be assigned confidently based on biogeography. (2) The taxon is changed to the new taxon and the subspecific rank is dropped because the fossil is not distinguishable at the subspecific level. For example, Alnus rugosa = Alnus incana subsp. rugosa, but may simply be changed to Alnus incana because the pollen of A. incana subsp. rugosa and A. incana subsp. incana are indistinguishable morphologically. rank change: genus reduced to subgenus: heterotypic or subjective synonym; a genus has been reduced to subgeneric rank in another family. At the generic level, this synonymy is clear from the naming conventions, e.g. Mictomys = Synaptomys (Mictomys); however, at the species level it is not, e.g. Mictomys borealis = Synaptomys borealis. rank change: family reduced to subfamily: heterotypic or subjective synonym; a family has been reduced to subfamily rank in another family. By botanical convention the family name is retained, e.g. Pyrolaceae = Ericaceae subf. Monotropoideae; whereas by zoological convention it is not, e.g. Desmodontidae = Desmodontinae. rank change: subspecific rank elevated to species: heterotypic or subjective synonym; a subspecies or variety has been raised to the species rank, e.g. Ephedra fragilis subsp. campylopoda = Ephedra foeminea. rank change: subgeneric rank elevated to genus: heterotypic or subjective synonym; a subgenus or other subgeneric rank has been raised to the generic rank. At the subgeneric level, this synonymy is clear from the naming conventions, e.g. Potamogeton subg. Coleogeton = Stuckenia; however, at the species level it is not, e.g. Potamogeton pectinatus = Stuckenia pectinata. rank change: subfamily elevated to family: heterotypic or subjective synonym; a subfamily has been raised to the family rank, e.g. Liliaceae subf. Amaryllidoideae = Amaryllidaceae, Pampatheriinae = Pampatheriidae. rank elevated because of taxonomic uncertainty: because the precise taxonomic identification is uncertain, the rank has been raised to a level that includes the universe of possible taxa. A common cause of such uncertainty is taxonomic splitting subsequent to the original identification, in which case the originally identified taxon is now a much smaller group. For example, the genus Psoralea has been divided into several genera; the genus Psoralea still exists, but now includes a much smaller number of species. Consequently, in the database Psoralea has been synonymized with Fabaceae tribe Psoraleeae, which includes the former Psoralea sensu lato. A zoological example is Mustela sp. The genus Mustela formerly included the minks, which have now been separated into the genus Neovison. Consequently, Mustela sp. = Mustela/Neovison sp. globally monospecific genus: Although identified at the genus level, specimens assigned to this genus can be further assigned to the species level because the genus is monospecific. globally monogeneric family: although identified at the family level, specimens assigned to this family can be further assigned to the genus level because the family is monogeneric. 6.5.1 SQL Example This query provides the preferred synonym in the database for Bison alleni along with the published authority for the synonymy and the notes in the database on the rationale for the synonymy.

Most taxa are biological taxa; however, some are biometric measures and some are physical parameters. TaxonID (Primary Key): An arbitrary Taxon identification number. TaxonCode: A code for the Taxon. These codes are useful for other software or output for which the complete name is too long. Because of the very large number of taxa, codes can be duplicated for different Taxa Groups. In general, these various Taxa Groups are analyzed separately, and no duplication will occur within a dataset. However, if Taxa Groups are combined, unique codes can be generated by prefixing with the TaxaGroupID, For example, VPL:Cle (Clethra) and MAM:Cle (Clethrionomys). A set of conventions has been established for codes. In some cases conventions differ depending on whether the organism is covered by rules of botanical nomenclature (BN) or zoological nomenclature (ZN). Genus: Three-letter code, first letter capitalized, generally the first three unless already used: Ace (Acer) or Cle (Clethrionomys). Subgenus: The genus code plus a two-letter subgenus code, first letter capitalized, separated by a period: Pin.Pi (Pinus subg. Pinus) or Syn.Mi (Synaptomys (Mictomys)). Species: The genus code plus a two-letter, lower-case species code, separated by a period: Ace.sa (Acer saccharum), Ace.sc (Acer saccharinum), or Cle.ga (Clethrionomys gapperi) Subspecies or variety: The species code a two-letter, lower-case subspecies code, separated by a period: Aln.vi.si (Alnus viridis subsp. sinuata), or Bis.bi.an (Bison bison antiquus) Family: Six-letter code, first letter capitalized, consisting of three letters followed by «eae» (BN) or «dae» (ZN): Roseae (Rosaceae), or Bovdae (Bovidae) Subfamily or tribe: (BN) Family code plus two-letter subfamily code, first letter capitalized, separated by a period. (ZN) Six-letter code, first letter capitalized, consisting of three letters followed by «nae»: Asteae.As (Asteraceae subf. Asteroideae), Asteae.Cy (Asteraceae tribe Cynarea), or Arvnae Arvicolinae. Order: (BN) Six-letter code, first letter capitalized, consisting of three letters followed by «les». (ZN) Six-letter code, first letter capitalized, consisting of three letters, followed by the last three letters of the order name, unless the order name is ≤6 letters long, in which case the code = the order name. Zoological orders do not have a common ending: Ercles (Ericales), Artyla (Artiodactyla), or Rodtia (Rodentia). Taxonomic levels higher than order: Six-letter code, first letter capitalized, consisting of three letters, followed by the last three letters of the order name, unless the order name is ≤6 letters long, in which case the code = the order name: Magida (Magnoliopsida), Magyta (Magnoliophyta), or Mamlia (Mammalia). Types The conventional taxon code followed by «-type»: Aln.in-t (Alnus incana-type), Amb-t (Ambrosia-type) cf. «cf. » is placed in the proper position: Odc.cf.he (Odocoileus cf. O. hemionus), cf.Odc.he (cf. Odocoileus hemionus), or cf.Odc (cf. Odocoileus). aff. «aff. » is abbreviated to «af. »: af.Can.di (aff. Canis dirus) ? «?» is placed in the proper position. ?Pro.lo (?*Procyon lotor*) Alternative names A slash is placed between the conventional abbreviations for the alternative taxa: Ost/Cpn (Ostrya/Carpinus), or Mstdae/Mepdae (Mustelidae/Mephitidae) Undifferentiated taxa (BN) «.ud» is added to the code. (ZN) «.sp » is added to the code: Aln.ud (Alnus undiff.), Roseae.ud (Rosaceae undiff.), Mms.sp (Mammuthus sp.), or Taydae.sp (Tayassuidae sp.). Parenthetic modifiers The conventional taxon code with an appropriate abbreviation for the modifier separated by periods. Multiple modifiers also separated by periods. Abbreviations for pollen morphological modifiers follow Iversen and Troels-Smith (1950): Raneae.C3 (Ranunculaceae (tricolpate)), Raneae.Cperi (Ranunculaceae (pericolpate)), Pineae.ves.ud (Pinaceae (vesiculate) undiff.), Myteae.Csyn.psi (Myrtaceae (syncolpate, psilate)), Bet.&gt;20µ (Betula (&gt;20 µm)) Non-biological taxa Use appropriate abbreviations: bulk.dens (Bulk density), LOI Loss-on-ignition, Bet.pol.diam (Betula mean pollen-grain diameter). TaxonName Name of the taxon. Most TaxonNames are biological taxa; however, some are biometric measures and some are physical parameters. In addition, some biological taxa may have parenthetic non-Latin modifers, e.g. «Betula (&gt;20 µm)» for Betula pollen grains &gt;20 µm in diameter. In general, the names used in Neotoma are those used by the original investigator. In particular, identifications are not changed, although Dataset notes can be added to the database regarding particular identifications. However, some corrections and synonymizations are made. These include: Misspellings are corrected. Nomenclatural, homotypic, or objective synonyms may be applied. Because these synonyms unambiguously refer to the same taxon, no change in identification is implied. For example, the old family name for the grasses «Gramineae» is changed to «Poaceae». Taxonomic, heterotypic, or subjective synonyms may be applied if the change does not effectively assign the specimen to a different taxon. Although two names may have been based on different type specimens, if further research has shown that these are in fact the same taxon, the name is changed to the accepted name. These synonymizations should not cause confusion. However, uncritical synonymization, although taxonomically correct, can result in loss of information, and should be avoided. For example, although a number of recent studies have shown that the Taxodiaceae should be merged with the Cupressaceae, simply synonymizing Taxodiaceae with Cupressaceae may expand the universe of taxa beyond that implied by the original investigator. For example, a palynologist in the southeastern United States may have used «Taxodiaceae» to imply «Taxodium», which is the only genus of the family that has occurred in the region since the Pliocene, but used the the family name because, palynologically, Taxodiuim cannot be differentiated from other Taxodiaceae. However, well preserved Taxodium pollen grains can be differentiated from the other Cupressaceous genera in the regin, Juniperus and Chamaecyperus. Thus, the appropriate synonymization for «Taxodiaceae» in this region would be «Taxodium» or «Taxodium-type», which would retain the original taxonomic precision. On the other hand, the old «TCT» shorthand for «Taxodiaceae/Cupressaceae/Taxaceae» now becomes «Cupressaceae/Taxaceae» with no loss of information. For alternative taxonomic desginations, the order may be changed. For example, «Ostrya/Carpinus» would be substituted for «Carpinus/Ostrya». The database has a number of conventions for uncertainty in identification. The uncertainty is included in the taxon name. Thus, «Acer pensylvanicum» and «Acer cf. A. pensylvanicum» are two different taxa. cf. Latin confer, which means compare. In taxonomy «cf. » generally means that the specimen compares well to or is similar to the type referred, but the identification is uncertain. Uncertainty may arise for a number of reasons. The specimen may not be well preserved. It may be nondescript. There may be other similar taxa that can not be ruled out. The analyst may not have access to a complete reference or comparative collection for the group, so other related taxa cannot be excluded with certainty. For uncertainty at the species level, the convention in Neotoma is, for example, «Odocoileus cf. O. hemionus», not «Odocoileus cf. hemionus». Placement of «cf. » is important, because it indicates the taxonomic level of uncertaintly. For example, «Odocoileus cf. O. hemionus» implies that the identification of Odocoileus is secure, but that the species identification is not; whereas «cf. Odocoileus hemionus» implies that not even the genus identification is certain. A further implication in the latter example is that if the genus identification is correct, then the the specimen must also be that species, perhaps because of biogeographic considerations. Although commonly overlooked, it is also important to indicate the proper level of uncertainly in family-genus identifications. For example, «Brassicaceae cf. Brassica» implies that assignment to the Brassicaceae is secure; whereas simply «cf. Brassica» does not indicate that even the family identification is certain. In FAUNMAP, the uncertainty is recorded in a separate field from the taxon name, and for species it is not discernable whether the uncertainty is at the genus or species level. When data were imported from FAUNMAP, the «cf. » uncertainty was conservatively assigned to the genus level. Thus, if «Bison bison» was indicated to have «cf. » uncertainty, this record was imported as «cf. Bison bison» rather than «Bison cf. B. bison». However, in many cases, the uncertainty in the original data was probably at the species level. aff. «aff. » Latin affinis, which means having affinity with, but distinct from, the referred taxon. This desgination is often applied to a taxon thought to be undescribed. Thus, «aff. Canis dirus» implies an affinity to Canus dirus, but the specimen is likely from another species. ? «?» is used to designate a questionable identification. It may indicate even less certainty than «cf. ». An example is «?Procyon lotor». Types Many pollen taxa are designated as types, e.g. «Ambrosia-type». A type denotes a morphological type that is consistent with the referred taxon, but also includes other taxa that are palynologically indistinguishable. For example, «Ambrosia-type» includes Ambrosia and Iva axillaris. The referred name commonly indicates the sporophyte taxon thought to be the most probable source of the pollen. An analyst may choose a «-type» designation referring to a lower taxonomic rank rather than an inclusive higher taxonomic rank because the referred taxon is thought to be the source taxon with very high probability. For example, in eastern , Pinus strobus is the only species of Pinus subg. Strobus, although several other species of this subgenus occur in western . Consequently, some analysts refer to «Pinus strobus-type» rather than «Pinus subg. Strobus». Ideally, a type would comprise a well defined universe of taxa, but in practice types are often vaguely defined. For example, in eastern «Populus balsamifera-type» includes a large proportion of P. balsamifera and probably smaller proportions of P. tremuloides, P. grandidentata, and P. deltoides; whereas «Populus tremuloides-type» includes larger proportions of these latter three species and a smaller proportion of P. balsamifera. However, these proportions are ill-defined. Alternative taxonomic designations In some cases, fossil specimens of two taxa are indistinguishable and are more-or-less equally likely. The names can then be separated by a slash, e.g. «Ostrya/Carpinus», «Mustelidae/Mephitidae». If one taxon is more likely, the analyst may choose to use a «-type» designation instead, e.g. «Ostrya-type». Although the order of alternative names may be changed by the database, a «-type» designation is not substituted for alternatives. However, the use of more two alternatives is discouraged. In cases in which taxonomic revisions have reduced the number of speices within a taxon, the original universe of species may be retained with the slash designation. An example is «Mustelidae», which in older literature included the skunks, which have now been placed in their own family the Mephitidae; thus «Mustelidae/Mephitidae» retains the original set of possible taxa. Undifferentiated taxa Lower taxonomic ranks may not be differentiated. The convention among palynologists is to specify these by the suffix «undiff. ». Thus, «Rosaceae undiff.» designates undifferentiated Rosaceae. However, palynologists have inconsistently applied the «undiff.» appellation, and the pollen databases established a convention that taxa must be mutually exclusive within a dataset. Thus, if a higher-rank taxon is present in a dataset, the «undiff.» suffix is applied only if lower-rank taxa are also present. For example, if «Spiraea» occurs in a dataset, «Rosaceae» would be changed to «Rosaceae undiff.», because Spiraea is a genus in the family Rosaceae. On the other hand, if «Rosaceae undiff.» occurs with no other Rosaceae, then «Rosaceae undiff.» is changed to simply «Rosaceae»; it is implicit that the family is not differentiated. Faunal analysts customarily use the appellation «sp.» to designate undifferentiated taxa. Thus, «Microtus sp.» indicates undifferentiated Microtus. In addition, faunal analysts regularly use the «sp.» designation even when no lower-rank taxa are identified. The «sp.» appellation is most frequently used with genera. The principle of taxonomic mutual exclusivity has not been applied to fauanl datasets, although it should probably be considered. Author Author(s) of the name. Neither the pollen database nor FAUNMAP stored author names, so these do not currently exist in Neotoma for plant and mammal names. These databases follow standard taxonomic references (e.g. Flora of North America, Flora Europaea, Wilson and Reeder's Mammal Species of the World), which, of course, do cite the original authors. However, for beetles, the standard practice is to cite original author names; therefore, this field was added to Neotoma. HigherTaxonID The TaxonID of the next higher taxonomic rank, for example, the HigherTaxonID for «Bison» is the TaxonID for «Bovidae». For «cf.'s» and «-types», the next higher rank may be much higher owing to the uncertainty of the identification; the HigherTaxonID for «cf. Bison bison» is the TaxonId for «Mammalia». The HigherTaxonID implements the taxonomic hierarchy in Neotoma. Extinct Boolean (True/False) variable. The value is True if the taxon is extinct, False if extant. TaxaGroupID (Foreign Key) The TaxaGroupID facilitates rapid extraction of taxa groups that are typically grouped together for analysis. Some of these groups contain taxa in different classes or phyla. For example, vascular plants include the Spermatophyta and Pteridophyta; the herps include Reptilia and Amphibia; the testate amoebae include taxa from different phyla.

Table is referenced by the variables table. VariableContextID (Primary Key) An arbitrary Variable Context identification number. VariableContext Depositional context. Examples are: anachronic: A specimen older than the primary deposit, e.g. a Paleozoic spore in a Holocene deposit. The specimen may be redeposited from the catchment, or may be derived from long distance, e.g. Tertiary pollen grains in Quaternary sediments with no local Tertiary source. A Pleistocene specimen in a Holocene archaeological deposit, possibly resulting from aboriginal fossil collecting, would also be anachronic. intrusive: A specimen, generally younger than the primary deposit, e.g. a domestic pig in an otherwise Pleistocene deposit. redeposited: A specimen older than the primary deposit and assumed to have been redeposited from a local source by natural causes. articulated: An articulated skeleton clump: A clump, esp. of pollen grains 6.10 VariableElements Lookup table of Variable Elements. Table is referenced by the variables table. VariableElementID (Primary Key) An arbitrary Variable Element identification number. VariableElement The element, part, or organ of the taxon identified. For plants, these include pollen, spores, and various macrofossil organs, such as «seed», «twig», «cone», and «cone bract». Thus, Betula pollen and Betula seeds are two different Variables. For mammals, Elements include the bone or tooth identified, e.g. «tibia». «tibia, distal, left», «M2, lower, left». Some more unusual elements are Neotoma fecal pellets and Erethizon dorsata quills. If no element is indicated for mammalian fauna, then the genric element «bone/tooth» is assigned. Elements were not assigned in FAUNMAP, so all Variables ingested from FAUNMAP were assigned the «bone/tooth» element. Physical Variables may also have elements. For example, the Loss-on-ignition Variables have «Loss-on-ignition» as a Taxon, and temperature of analysis as an element, e.g. «500°C», «900°C». Charcoal Variables have the size fragments as elements, e.g. «75-100 µm», «100-125 µm». 6.11 VariableModifications Lookup table of Variable Modifications. Table is referenced by the variables table. VariableModificationID (Primary Key) An arbitrary Variable Modification identification number. VariableModification Modification to a specimen. Examples of modifications to bones include «carnivore gnawed», «rodent gnawed», «burned», «human butchering». Modifications to pollen grains include various preservation states, e.g. «1/2 grains», «degraded», «corroded», «broken». Most Variables do not have a modification assigned. 6.12 VariableUnits Lookup table of Variable Units. Table is referenced by the variables table. VariableUnitsID (Primary Key) An arbitrary Variable Units identification number. VariableUnit The units of measurement. For fauna, these are «present/absent», «NISP» (Number of Individual Specimens), and «MNI» (Minimum Number of Individals). For pollen, these are «NISP» (pollen counts) and «percent». Units for plant macrofossils include «present/abesnt» and «NISP», as well as a number of quantitative concentration measurements and semi-quantitative abundance measurements such as «1-5 scale». Examples of charcoal measurement units are «fragments/ml» and «µm^2/ml». 6.13 RepositoryInstitutions A lookup table of institutions that are repositories for fossil specimens. Table is referenced by the repositoryspecimens table. RepositoryID (PrimaryKey) An arbitrary Repository identification number. Repositories include museums, university departments, and various governmental agencies. Acronym A unique acronym for the repository. Many repositories have well-established acronyms (e.g. AMNH = of Natural History); however, there is no official list. Various acronyms have been used for some institutions, and in some cases the same acronym has been used for different institutions. Consequently, the database acronym may differ from the acronym used in some publications. For example, «CMNH» has been used for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, and the Cincinnati Museum of Natural History. In Neotoma, two of these institutions were assigned different acronyms, ones that have been used for them in other publications: CM – Carnegie Museum of Natural History, CLM – Cleveland Museum of Natural History. Repository The full name of the repository. Notes Free form notes or comments about the repository, especially notes about name changes, closures, and specimen transfers. In some cases, it is known that the specimens were transferred, but their current disposition may be uncertain. 6.14 RepositorySpecimens This table lists the repositories in which fossil specimens have been accessioned or reposited. The inventory in Neotoma is by Dataset, which is the collection of specimens from a Collection Unit. Occasionally, specimens from a single Collection Unit have been reposited at different institutions, in which case multiple records for that Dataset occur in the table.

This table is referenced by the chronologies and geochronology tables. AgeTypeID (Primary Key): An arbitrary Age Type identification number. AgeType: Age type or units. Includes the following: Calendar years AD/BC Calendar years BP Calibrated radiocarbon years BP Radiocarbon years BP Varve years BP 7.2 AggregateChronologies This table stores metadata for Aggregate Chronologies. An Aggregate Chronology refers to an explicit chronology assigned to a sample Aggregate. The individual Aggregate Samples have ages assigned in the aggregatesampleages table. An Aggregate Chronology would be used, for example, for a set of packrat middens assigned to an aggregatedatasets. The Aggregate Chronology is analagous to the Chronology assigned to samples from a single Collection Unit. An Aggregate may have more than one Aggregate Chronology, for example one in radiocarbon years and another in calibrated radiocarbon years. One Aggreagate Chronology per Age Type may be designated the default, which is the Aggregate Chronology currently preferred by the database stewards. AggregateChronID (Primary Key): An arbitrary Aggregate Chronology identification number. AggregateDatasetID (Foreign Key): Dataset to which the Aggregate Chronology applies. Field links to the aggregatedatasets table. AgeTypeID (Foreign Key): Age type or units. Field links to the agetypes table. IsDefault: Indicates whether the Aggregate Chronology is a default or not. Default status is determined by a Neotoma data steward. Aggregate Datasets may have more than one default Aggregate Chronology, but may have only one default Aggregate Chronology per Age Type. ChronologyName: Optional name for the Chronology. AgeBoundYounger: The younger reliable age bound for the Aggregate Chronology. Younger ages may be assigned to samples, but are not regarded as reliable. If the entire Chronology is considered reliable, AgeBoundYounger is assigned the youngest sample age rounded down to the nearest 10. Thus, for 72 BP, AgeBoundYounger = 70 BP; for -45 BP, AgeBoundYounger = -50 BP. AgeBoundOlder: The older reliable age bound for the Aggregate Chronology. Ages older than AgeOlderBound may be assigned to samples, but are not regarded as reliable. This situation is particularly true for ages extrapolated beyond the oldest Chron Control. . If the entire Chronology is considered reliable, AgeBoundOlder is assigned the oldest sample age rounded up to the nearest 10. Thus, for 12564 BP, AgeBoundOlder is 12570. Notes: Free form notes or comments about the Aggregate Chronology. 7.3 ChronControls This table stores data for Chronology Controls, which are the age-depth control points used for age models. These controls may be geophysical controls, such as radiocarbon dates, but include many other kinds of age controls, such as biostratigraphic controls, archaeological cultural associations, and volcanic tephras. In the case of radiocarbon dates, a Chronology Control may not simply be the raw radiocarbon date reported by the laboratory, but perhaps a radiocarbon date corrected for an old carbon reservoir, a calibrated radiocarbon date, or an average of several radiocarbon dates from the same level. A common control for lake-sediment cores is the age of the top of the core, which may be the year the core was taken or perhaps an estimate of 0 BP if a few cm of surficial sediment were lost. ChronControlID (Primary Key): An arbitrary Chronology Control identification number. ChronologyID (Foreign Key): Chronology to which the ChronControl belongs. Field links to the Chronolgies table. ChronControlTypeID (Foreign Key): The type of Chronology Control. Field links to the chroncontroltypes table. Depth: Depth of the Chronology Control in cm. Thickness: Thickness of the Chronology Control in cm. Age: Age of the Chronology Control. AgeLimitYounger: The younger age limit of a Chronology Control. This limit may be explicitly defined, for example the younger of the 2-sigma range limits of a calibrated radiocarbon date, or it may be more loosely defined, for example the younger limit on the range of dates for a biostratigraphic horizon. AgeLimitOlder: The older age limit of a Chronology Control. Notes: Free form notes or comments about the Chronology Control. 7.4 ChronControlTypes Lookup table of Chronology Control Types. This table is referenced by the chroncontrols table. ChronControlTypeID (Primary Key): An arbitrary Chronology Control Type identification number. ChronControlType: The type of Chronology Control object. Chronology Controls include such geophysical controls as radiocarbon dates, calibrated radiocarbon dates, averages of several radiocarbon dates, potassium-argon dates, and thermoluminescence dates, as well as biostratigraphic controls, sediment stratigraphic contols, volcanic tephras, archaeological cultural associations, and any other types of age controls. In general these are calibrated or calendar year dates Before Present (BP). Some ChronControlTypes are in Radiocarbon Years, so caution must be exercised. 7.5 Chronologies This table stores Chronology data. A Chronology refers to an explicit chronology assigned to a Collection Unit. A Chronology has Chronology Controls, the actual age-depth control points, which are stored in the chroncontrols table. A Chronology is also based on an Age Model, which may be a numerical method that fits a curve to a set of age-depth control points or may simply be individually dated Analysis Units. A Collection Unit may have more than one Chronology, for example one in radiocarbon years and another in calibrated radiocarbon years. There may be a Chronology developed by the original author and another developed by a later research project. Chronologies may be stored for archival reasons, even though they are now believed to have problems, if they were used for an important research project. One Chronology per Age Type may be designated the default Chronology, which is the Chronology currently preferred by the database stewards. Based upon the Chronology, which includes the Age Model and the Chron Controls, ages are assigned to individual samples, which are stored in the SampleAges table. A younger and older age bounds are assigned to the Chronology. Within these bounds the Chronology is regarded as reliable. Ages may be assigned to samples beyond the reliable age bounds, but these are not considered reliable. ChronologyID (Primary Key): An arbitrary Chronology identification number. CollectionUnitID (Foreign Key): Collection Unit to which the Chronology applies. Field links to the collectionunits[#CollectionUnits] table. AgeTypeID (Foreign Key): Age type or units. Field links to the AgeTypes table. ContactID (Foreign Key): Person who developed the Age Model. Field links to the contacts[#Contacts] table. IsDefault: Indicates whether the Chronology is a default chronology or not. Default status is determined by a Neotoma data steward. Collection Units may have more than one default Chronology, but may have only one default Chronology per Age Type. Thus, there may be a default radiocarbon year Chronology and a default calibrated radiocarbon year Chronology, but only one of each. Default Chronologies may be used by the Neotoma web site, or other web sites, for displaying default diagrams or time series of data. Default Chronologies may also be of considerable use for actual research purposes; however, users may of course choose to develop their own chronologies. ChronologyName: Optional name for the Chronology. Some examples are: COHMAP chron 1 A Chronology assigned by the COHMAP project. COHMAP chron 2 An alternative Chronology assigned by the COHMAP project NAPD 1 A Chronology assigned by the North American Pollen Database. Gajewski 1995 A Chronology assigned by Gajewski (1995). DatePrepared: Date that the Chronology was prepared. AgeModel: The age model used for the Chronology. Some examples are: linear interpolation, 3rd order polynomial, and individually dated analysis units. AgeBoundYounger: The younger reliable age bound for the Chronology. Younger ages may be assigned to samples, but are not regarded as reliable. If the entire Chronology is considered reliable, AgeBoundYounger is assigned the youngest sample age rounded down to the nearest 10. Thus, for 72 BP, AgeBoundYounger = 70 BP; for -45 BP, AgeBoundYounger = -50 BP. AgeBoundOlder: The older reliable age bound for the Chronology. Ages older than AgeOlderBound may be assigned to samples, but are not regarded as reliable. This situation is particularly true for ages extrapolated beyond the oldest Chron Control. . If the entire Chronology is considered reliable, AgeBoundOlder is assigned the oldest sample age rounded up to the nearest 10. Thus, for 12564 BP, AgeBoundOlder is 12570. Notes: Free form notes or comments about the Chronology. 7.5.1 SQL Example The following SQL statement produces a list of Chronologies for a particular site. In this case we are matching on the site name, for “Irvin Lake”, : SELECT st.sitename, ch.chronologyid, ch.chronologyname, ch.isdefault, at.agetype FROM ndb.sites AS st INNER JOIN ndb.collectionunits AS cu ON cu.siteid = st.siteid INNER JOIN ndb.chronologies AS ch ON ch.collectionunitid = cu.collectionunitid INNER JOIN ndb.agetypes AS at ON at.agetypeid = ch.agetypeid WHERE st.sitename = &#39;Irvin Lake&#39;; Table 7.1: 5 records sitename chronologyid chronologyname isdefault agetype Irvin Lake 546 NAPD 1 FALSE Radiocarbon years BP Irvin Lake 14872 Blois et al. 2011 FALSE Calibrated radiocarbon years BP Irvin Lake 14933 Neotoma 1 FALSE Calibrated radiocarbon years BP Irvin Lake 25094 PalEON-STEPPS TRUE Calibrated radiocarbon years BP Irvin Lake 34296 Wang et al. 2019 FALSE Calibrated radiocarbon years BP From this we see that there have been five chronologies generated for Irvin Lake. There are two age types represented, Radiocarbon years and Calibrated radiocarbon years BP. There is one default age model for Calibrated radiocarbon years BP and, at the time of this writing, the NAPD 1 data model is not defined as the default. This is counter to the general data entry standard, where each age type has a defined default chronology. 7.5.2 SQL Example The following statement produces a list of the chronological controls for the default chronology from Wolsfeld Lake in Calibrated radiocarbon years BP. The dates are arranged by depth. It is worth noting that for many records the chroncontrols are not the same as the geochronological records recorded from the site: SELECT cc.depth, cc.age, cc.agelimityounger, cc.agelimitolder, cct.chroncontroltype FROM ndb.sites AS st INNER JOIN ndb.collectionunits AS cu ON cu.siteid = st.siteid INNER JOIN ndb.chronologies AS ch ON ch.collectionunitid = cu.collectionunitid INNER JOIN ndb.agetypes AS at ON at.agetypeid = ch.agetypeid INNER JOIN ndb.chroncontrols AS cc ON cc.chronologyid = ch.chronologyid INNER JOIN ndb.chroncontroltypes AS cct ON cct.chroncontroltypeid = cc.chroncontroltypeid WHERE st.sitename = &#39;Wolsfeld Lake&#39; AND ch.isdefault IS TRUE AND at.agetype = &#39;Calibrated radiocarbon years BP&#39; ORDER BY cc.depth ASC; Table 7.2: Displaying records 1 - 10 depth age agelimityounger agelimitolder chroncontroltype 0 0 -30 30 Core top 715 630 575 685 Radiocarbon 750 800 740 860 Radiocarbon 785 920 860 980 Radiocarbon 975 2790 2725 2855 Radiocarbon 1065 3705 3645 3765 Radiocarbon 1135 4030 3955 4105 Radiocarbon 1345 5640 5570 5710 Radiocarbon 1415 6580 6500 6660 Radiocarbon 1520 7990 7880 8100 Radiocarbon 7.6 AggregateSampleAges This table stores the links to the ages of samples in an Aggregate Dataset. The table is necessary because samples may be from Collection Units with multiple chronologies, and this table stores the links to the sample ages desired for the Aggregate Dataset.

In this case, the chronolgies table must be linked into a query to obtain the ages of aggregatesamples, and either the AgeTypeID must be specified in the Chronolgies table or the agetypes table must also be linked with the AgeType specified. The following SQL statement produces a list of Sample ID numbers and «Radiocarbon years BP» ages for the «» Aggregate Dataset: samples. SELECT agd.aggregatedatasetname, ags.sampleid, sa.age, aty.agetype FROM ndb.aggregatedatasets AS agd INNER JOIN ndb.aggregatesampleages AS agsa ON agsa.aggregatedatasetid = agd.aggregatedatasetid INNER JOIN ndb.aggregatesamples AS ags ON ags.aggregatedatasetid = agd.aggregatedatasetid INNER JOIN ndb.sampleages AS sa ON sa.sampleid = ags.sampleid AND sa.sampleageid = agsa.sampleageid INNER JOIN ndb.chronologies AS ch ON ch.chronologyid = sa.chronologyid INNER JOIN ndb.agetypes AS aty ON aty.agetypeid = ch.agetypeid WHERE agd.aggregatedatasetname = &#39;Roberts Creek&#39;; Table 7.4: Displaying records 1 - 10 aggregatedatasetname sampleid age agetype Roberts Creek 44627 0 Radiocarbon years BP Roberts Creek 44628 380 Radiocarbon years BP Roberts Creek 44629 1220 Radiocarbon years BP Roberts Creek 44630 1820 Radiocarbon years BP Roberts Creek 44631 2050 Radiocarbon years BP Roberts Creek 44632 2330 Radiocarbon years BP Roberts Creek 44633 2860 Radiocarbon years BP Roberts Creek 44634 3080 Radiocarbon years BP Roberts Creek 44635 3530 Radiocarbon years BP Roberts Creek 44636 4175 Radiocarbon years BP 7.7 geochronology This table stores geochronologic data. Geochronologic measurements are from geochronologic samples, which are from Analysis Units, which may have a depth and thickness. Geochronologic measurements may be from the same or different Analysis Units as fossils. In the case of faunal excavations, geochronologic samples are typically from the same Analysis Units as the fossils, and there may be multiple geochronologic samples from a single Analysis Unit.
